# Convex Hull Algorithm in Prolog

This repository contains an implementation of the Convex Hull algorithm using Prolog, developed for a university Programming Languages course. 

## Project Overview

The project demonstrates the application of Graham's Scan method to find the convex hull of a set of points. This algorithm is particularly useful in robotics for tasks like pathfinding and obstacle avoidance.

## Purpose

The primary objective was to understand and implement the Convex Hull algorithm in Prolog, enhancing skills in logic programming and algorithm development.

## Outcome

The project was successfully completed and received the highest grade in the course.
